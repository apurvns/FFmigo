# FFmigo

FFmigo is a smart tool designed to simplify video and audio editing by translating your plain English instructions into complex FFmpeg commands. Instead of memorizing confusing command-line options, you can simply tell FFmigo what you want to do—like "trim my video to the first 10 seconds" or "add my logo to the bottom right corner"—and it will instantly generates and executes the correct command for you.

At its core, FFmigo uses an AI to understand your request and act as your expert FFmpeg assistant, making powerful video editing accessible to everyone, from content creators to developers.
